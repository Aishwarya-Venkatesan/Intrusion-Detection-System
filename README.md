# Intrusion-Detection-System
A Dataset of size 42,000 and target variable of 3 classes of attacks, is trained with various supervised machine learning models like Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Network and evaluated. With proper pre-pruning and implementation of models, it yields a maximum of 94.8% accuracy in case of Random Forest.
